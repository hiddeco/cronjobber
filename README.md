Cronjobber is the cronjob controller from Kubernetes patched with time zone support.

## Installation

```sh
# Install CustomResourceDefinition
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiddeco/cronjobber/master/deploy/crd.yaml
# Setup service account and RBAC
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiddeco/cronjobber/master/deploy/rbac.yaml
# Deploy Cronjobber (using the timezone db from the node)
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiddeco/cronjobber/master/deploy/deploy.yaml
```

### Keeping your timezone database up-to-date

> :warning: **Note:** the approach below does not work at present due to an
> issue with Go which causes it to silently fail on `slim` timezone database
> formats (the default since `tzdata>=2020-b`) ([go#42138](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42138)).

Cronjobber embeds a default timezone database in its binary, this database is
however not updated regularly. To help your overcome this issue there is an
[`cronjobber-updatetz`](https://quay.io/repository/hiddeco/cronjobber-updatetz)
image available that can be used as a sidecar.

```sh
# Deploy Cronjobber (using the updatetz sidecar)
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiddeco/cronjobber/master/deploy/deploy-updatetz.yaml
```

You may want to tweak the following environment variables to control
how often it looks for updates and where it puts the timezone database.

- `TZPV` (default: `/tmp/zoneinfo`) is where the timezone database
  is extracted
- `REFRESH_INTERVAL` (default: `7d`) is how often it looks for updates

## Usage

Instead of creating a [`CronJob`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/)
like you normally would, you create a `TZCronJob`, which works exactly
the same but supports an additional field: `.spec.timezone`. Set this
to the time zone you wish to schedule your jobs in and Cronjobber will
take care of the rest.

```yaml
apiVersion: cronjobber.hidde.co/v1alpha1
kind: TZCronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  timezone: "Europe/Amsterdam"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox
              args:
                - /bin/sh
                - -c
                - date; echo "Hello, World!"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Reasoning

There has been a [long outstanding issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47202)
to add time zone support to the `CronJob` API in Kubernetes, including
a [fully working PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47266)
which actually made it possible. SIG Apps and in SIG Architecture
decided however against adding it because of the downside of having
to manage and distribute time zone databases.

Cronjobber is the most simple answer to this: it is the original PR
on top of a more recent version of the cronjob controller, with some
glue added to make it an independent controller.
